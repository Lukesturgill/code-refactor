For the code refactor challenge, I updated the HTML with semantic elements and consolidated the CSS selectors. I also made sure all <img> elements were equipped
with "alt" tags, in the event the webpage doesn't properly display the image sourced, the 'alt" tag would give a description of the image being depicted.
